Stack contains resources that are defined in yaml files (ec2, s3 etc). 
The output would be lamddafunction name, arn, function arn, so it can be used somewhere else as well.


UPCOMING TASK:
-Access givre by role (role make sure if i am capable of doing that)
var awssdk = require('aws-sdk') # avialable by default we don't need to package it in this dynamodb file
-aws sdk -->    dynamodb.getitem
-SES is an aws built in service used to send email
-call it in dynamodb fetch lamdba (call lamda using existing lambda through SNS(notification service))
-give sns permission as well
-Exsting  lambda will call another lamda using sns and second lambda will give email using ses
